It was a wild ride today, it felt like I don't really know what I'm doing.
set up the docker yaml for utilizing react and mongoDB
went through the documentation to set up the account creation function for P.gamma and successfully set up the function

6/27
Today was big on progress as we were able to complete parts of the backend and create the get functionality of tastyAPI and SpoonacularAPI.
My team is very tactful with how we approach troubleshooting issues. We were able to make most of the backend CRUD functions work and stopped at the delete function

6/28
Riley's walkthrough of the backend using mongoDB was a tremendous help and we were able to get the all the CRUD functions established.
-finished the CRUD functions of the backend
-created ingredient file for routers and queries,
-created the ability to let a user rate a recipe using keys from an API to see as a proof of concept

7/10
Went over previous concepts in FastAPI and looked into how to use/implement modals for react. Did not code in the module 3 project. Spent time recalibrating on things that diminished over the week break.

7/11
Finished the functionality for the login, logout, signin, and signup pages for RecipeHunt. Also built the authentication for user accounts using redux. Created the baseline for the main page and completed the functionality of it.

7/12
Created the Details page for RecipeHunt. Decided on using React Redux to build the frontend. added apiSlice.js, recipeSlice.js, store.js, and RecipeDetails.js. My teammates are truly great. Also found out that spoonacular has two different API keys that somehow work on multiple parts of their website.

7/13
Created the functionality to favorite a recipe and add it to your account page.
Added apiSlice, recipeSlice, searchSlice.

Tomorrow:

-ask Riley about how to let customers/user not run into the error
-profile page
-ingredients that go with the profile page
