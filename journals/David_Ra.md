Today was big on progress as we were able to complete parts of the backend and create the get functionality of tastyAPI and SpoonacularAPI.
My team is very tactful with how we approach troubleshooting issues. We were able to make most of the backend CRUD functions work and stopped at the delete function

Riley's walkthrough of the backend using mongoDB was a tremendous help and we were able to get the all the CRUD functions established.
