Today, we worked as a group to create the backend authentication. Javier shared his screen and the four of us talked through what we believed would be the way to start building the authentication file. It was very difficult since there were a lot of moving parts to authentication in the backend, but it seems like we were able to figure it out. It was great since as soon as anyone had an idea, we tried it out to see if it worked. So far, the creating an account, logining in, and logging out functionality seems to work when we run the code on FastAPI. We also built up our database using MongoDB before we started anything else.
