Today was fairly tough. I felt like I was flying a bit by the seat of my pants. I fell a bit behind last week with the learn modules, so a lot of the work felt like information that I had not gone through before. My partners definitely led the way when it came to the backend authentication portion of this project. I'm going to be working today to catch up on learns so I can provide more use during upcoming days. We got our backend authentication sorted out, and so tomorrow we plan on getting our backend CRUD paths sorted.
