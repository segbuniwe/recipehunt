Journal Entry: Today was fairly tough. I felt like I was flying a bit by the seat of my pants. I fell a bit behind last week with the learn modules, so a lot of the work felt like information that I had not gone through before. My partners definitely led the way when it came to the backend authentication portion of this project. I'm going to be working today to catch up on learns so I can provide more use during upcoming days. We got our backend authentication sorted out, and so tomorrow we plan on getting our backend CRUD paths sorted.

Journal Entry:

This morning I took over the start of coding for the team. I was in charge of building out the recipes query and router page for spoonacular and adjusting the accounts.py functions. From there. We were not able to get the Spoonacular API to work due to issues with the API website, so Sophia took over and we helped her with building out the Tasty API to make sure we were correctly building out the CRUD functions to pull Tasty API information. We got these to work, and from here we built out the Ingredients router and query pages for the Ingredients collection. We were able to create the Ingredients and connect them to specific profiles that were created. End of day, the Spoonacular API started working again, so we built out GET methods to retrieve information from that API as well.

Today was a bit more tough for me. Initially Riley went through an Authentication discussion which was very thorough, and from there my group (partiulcarly Sophia) took notes and we were able to make adjustments and have our authentication measures completed quickly. Riley had also gone through creating a Favorites Query and Route in his discussion which was a key component for our website. We had that built out with Sophia covering the main coding part, and we had a strong start. In the afternoon, fatigue hit me pretty hard and I felt like I became a bit quieter in order to understand what was happening. Sophia and Javier took on creating a ratings query and route, and they did a great job with following the bug trail in order to get it to functionally work. It makes sense with how they built it out, but we are going to check if the functionality is correctly formatted with Riley just because the code we have now causes us to fill in a receipe_id vs. automatically pulling it from the recipe collection. We might be pulling that on the front end with hooks and then pulling back the information with the backend.
